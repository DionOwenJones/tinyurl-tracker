    original_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    short_code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

-- Clicks table
CREATE TABLE clicks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    short_code TEXT NOT NULL,
    ip_address TEXT,
    latitude DOUBLE PRECISION,
    longitude DOUBLE PRECISION,
    city TEXT,
    country TEXT,
    clicked_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

This repository contains a working implementation using:
